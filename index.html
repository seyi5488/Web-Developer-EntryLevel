                <h1>I'm Oyewole Oluwaseyi and I am an aspiring Favcoder</h1>
                <p>My mission for Favcode is to: Develop and deploy enterprise software products.</p>
                <h2>This is why you should choose me</h2>
                <p>This intership opportunity will help push me further towards my career as a programmer and my dreams of one day having a successful career as a web designer. I also believe in giving back to my community by helping others  especially startups in building a responsive website to increase sells via various online means.
                Five years from now I see myself employed at a large local tech firm, writing and debugging codes, evaluating,and solving certain problems related to web design and software development. I just feel blessed that I am given the opportunity to intern with your reputable organization to help fulfill my dream and I will prove that I do have what it takes to not only be a successful student, but an outstanding web designer and software developer.
                I live in a place where you have people with varying skills such as baking,furniture works, fashion designing to list but in few. 
                Most of these people have startup businesses but don't have enough capital to get online presence via website. My goal is to make website for them through knowledge gained through this scholarship if i am chosen and i have started the journey by taking courses with ALCwithGoogle and through personal studies.</p>
